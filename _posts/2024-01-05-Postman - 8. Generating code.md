## Postman's codegen feature

Postman can help you integrate API calls into your apps by [generating code snippets](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/generate-code-snippets/) in various coding languages.

### Generating code snippets

Every request you made has a code generation tab you can access from the `</>` icon in the far right:

Once the code snippet generator pane is open, you can select from a dropdown to generate the API request in common coding languages:

For example, we can generate the `GET /books` request in `curl` syntax:

![](https://everpath-course-content.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/instructor%2F26fp2261340y1ukokimvca8su%2Fpublic%2F1649891410%2Frecap+3.1649891410496.png){: .normal}

If we copy this snippet into the termial, we make the API call and the response body is printed:

```shell
$ curl --location 'https://library-api.postmanlabs.com/books' \
--header 'api-key: postmanrulz'
