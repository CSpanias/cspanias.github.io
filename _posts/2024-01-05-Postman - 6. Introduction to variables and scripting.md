## Variables in Postman

Previously in the [**Request Parameters**](https://cspanias.github.io/posts/Postman-4.-Request-Parameters/) section, we saw how using a variable saved us time and helped reduce redundant copy-paste of the request URL using the double curly brace syntax like this: `{{variableName}}`. Remember, Postman allows you to save values as [variables](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/variables/) so that you can:
1. Reuse values to keep your work [DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself#:~:text=%22Don't%20repeat%20yourself%22,data%20normalization%20to%20avoid%20redundancy.)
2. Hide sensitive values like API Keys from being shared publicly.

In this section, we will learn more about variables and introduce better practices that enables us to make dynamic requests.

### Variable scopes

You can set variables that live at various [scopes](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/variables/#variable-scopes). Postman will resolve to the value at the nearest and narrowest scope. From broadest to narrowest, these scopes are **global**, **collection**, **environment**, **data**, and **local**.

![](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/var-scope-v10.jpg)

If a variable with the same name is declared in two different scopes, the value stored in the variable with the narrowest scope will be used. For example, if there is a global variable named `username` and a local variable named `username`, the latter will be used when the request runs.

We will work with **collection variables** today, which live at the collection level and can be accessed anywhere inside the collection.

## Settings variables programmatically

### Scripting in Postman

Postman allows you to add automation and dynamic behaviors to your collections with [scripting](https://learning.postman.com/docs/writing-scripts/intro-to-scripts/). Postman will automatically execute any provided scripts during two events in the request flow:
1. Immediately before a request is sent: [pre-request script](https://learning.postman.com/docs/writing-scripts/pre-request-scripts/) (**Pre-request Script** tab of request).
2. Immediately after a response comes back: [test script](https://learning.postman.com/docs/writing-scripts/test-scripts/)(**Tests** tab of request).

In this lesson, we will focus on writing scripts in the **Tests** tab, which are executed when a response comes back from an API.

### The `pm` object

Postman has a helper object named [`pm`](https://learning.postman.com/docs/writing-scripts/script-references/postman-sandbox-api-reference/#the-pm-object) that gives you access to data about your Postman environment, requests, variables and testing utilities. For example, you can access the JSON response body from an API with: `pm.response.json()`. You can also programmatically get collection variables like the value of `baseUrl` with: `pm.collectionVariables.get(“baseUrl”)`.

In addition to getting variables, you can also set them with: `pm.collectionVariables.set("variableName", "variableValue")`.

## Task: Your first script

If you are new to JavaScript, here are some basics.

### Logging data

In JS you can print data for a value to the console using this syntax:

```javascript
console.log("Hello world!")
// => Hello world!
```

### Comments

In JS you can add comments to your code. These are skipped by the interpreter,so you can use them to explain things in your code.

```javascript
// Single line comments start with two slashes. I am not code!

/* You can write multi-line comments by 
opening and closing with slash and asterisk. 
I am not code!
*/
```

### Add a script to your request

1. In your **add a book** request, change the book data in your **Body** to a new book you like.
2. Open the **Tests** tab of the request.
3. Inside the **Tests Editor**, **add this JS code** to log the JSON response from the API:

    ```javascript
    console.log(pm.response.json())
    ```

    ![](https://everpath-course-content.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/instructor%2F4qlhnpfiaeqby6zwhuhhmacvx%2Fpublic%2F1694636073%2FScreen+Recording+2023-09-14+at+1.43.16+AM.1694636072345.gif)

4. **Save** and **Send** your request. This will trigger the script in the **Tests** tab to run after the response comes back from the API.
5. **Open the Postman Console** in the lower left of the window:

    ![](https://everpath-course-content.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/instructor%2F4qlhnpfiaeqby6zwhuhhmacvx%2Fpublic%2F1694636318%2FScreen+Recording+2023-09-14+at+1.45.55+AM.1694636316551.gif)

6. Scroll to the bottom of the logs in the console. You will see the more recent request: `POST https://library-api.poistmanlabs.com/books`. The response data from the API is logged in the console because of the code in our **Tests** tab. You can **expand the data** by clicking on the small arrow to the left:

## Task: Grab the new book id

Combining the power of variables and scripting gives you superpowers! Let's explore how you can automatically set a value for a variable via scripting. Saving a value as a variable allows you to use it in other requests. Using a **Test** script, let's grab the `id` of a newly added book and save it so we can use it in future requests.

### Setting and getting collection variables

The `pm` object allows you to set and get collection variables. To **set** a collection variable, use the `.set()` method with two parameters: the variable name and the variable value: `pm.collectionVariables.set("variableName", value)`. To **get** a collection variable use the `.get()` method and specify the name of the variable: `pm.collectionVariables.get("variableName")`.

### Local variables

We can also store local variables inside our **Test** script using JS. There are two ways to define a variable in JS: 
1. Using the `const` keyword
2. Using the `let` keyword

`const` is for variables that won't change value, whereas `let` allows you to reassign the value later.

```javascript
// -- Defining variables with const --
const myVar = "This variable can't be reassigned"
console.log(myVar) // => This variable can't be reassigned

// attempt to reassign the value of myVar
myVar = "foo" 
//=> [ERROR!] Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.

// -- Defining variables with let -- 
let myVar2 = "I can change!"
console.log(myVar2) // => I can change!

myVar2 = "See, I changed!"
console.log(myVar2) // => See, I changed
```

### Set the new book `id` as a variable

1. In the **Body** tab of the **add a book** request, **change the book's details to add a new book**.
2. In the **Tests** tab of thet **add a book** request, replace the `console.log()` statement with this code:

    ```javascript
    // save the value of the "id" value from the API JSON response to a const variable named "id"
    const id = pm.response.json().id
    // set the value of the "id" variable to a collection variable also called "id".
    pm.collectionVariables.set("id", id)
    ```

    If there is no Collection variable named `id` postman will create a new variable named `id` and assign the value.

3. **Save** and **Send** the request. When the `201` reponse comes back from the API, the test script will run and save the book's `id` as a collection variable automatically.

    ![](https://everpath-course-content.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/instructor%2F4qlhnpfiaeqby6zwhuhhmacvx%2Fpublic%2F1694637148%2FScreen+Recording+2023-09-14+at+2.00.14+AM.1694637147685.gif)

4. View your collection variables by clicking on your **Postmane Library API v2** collection, then the **Variables** tab. The `id` variable has been automatically assigned the id of your new book as its **CURRENT VALUE**.

    ![](https://everpath-course-content.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/instructor%2F26fp2261340y1ukokimvca8su%2Fpublic%2F1649770495%2Fset+id+2.1649770495600.png)

You can now use `{{id}}` anywhere in your collection to access this value.

## Halfway Test

Let's do a halfway check of your collection before we proceed further. This test will help you evaluate your tasks and stay on track for the rest of the course. 

### Test your collection locally

Follow the instructions below to [fork](https://learning.postman.com/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/forking-entities/) a test collection into your workspace. You can follow the video or the instructions to get started:

![]()

1. For the test collection into your workspace by clicking [this link](https://www.postman.com/postman-student-programs/workspace/postman-api-fundamentals-student-expert-test-your-collection/overview) and following the guide below.
2. While hovering on the collection called **Collection Test** from the link above, click on the three dots, and **Create a fork**:
    
    ![](https://whimuc.com/PwqrrQiv3tT4JsqRDkan2a/FHySBVRsvYtXWV.png){: .normal}

3. On the next screen, choose your workspace (**API Fundamentals Student Expert**) as the destination workspace to send your forked collection, then click **Fork collection**. You should now 2 collections in your workspace: your **Postman Library API v2** and the forked **Collection Test**:

    ![](https://whimuc.com/PwqrrQiv3tT4JsqRDkan2a/2MsxuvQSnhrNFt.png)

4. Get the API link for your **entire Postman Library API v2 collection**: click **View more actions** on your collection > **Share** > **Via API** > **Generate New Key** > **Copy**. This will create a read-only API key that will allow anyone with this link to access a JSON representation of your collection:

    ![](https://everpath-course-content.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/instructor%2F4qlhnpfiaeqby6zwhuhhmacvx%2Fpublic%2F1695639424%2FScreen+Recording+2023-09-25+at+4.23.49+PM.1695639423485.gif)

5. Navigate to your forked **Collection Test** collection, open the **Variables** tab, and **paste** the link in your clipboard copied in the previous step into the collection variable named `submission`. Make sure the URL is set on both columns: **Initial value** and **Current value**. Postman will always use the latter which is local to your Postman instance, but the setting of the former allows you to persist this value outside of your current Postman instance - for example if you share your collection with a friend:

6. **Save** the Collection and **Send** the `Halfway Test` request.

    ![](https://everpath-course-content.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/instructor%2F4qlhnpfiaeqby6zwhuhhmacvx%2Fpublic%2F1695641389%2FScreen+Recording+2023-09-25+at+4.30.09+PM+%281%29.1695641388925.gif)

7. Check the **Test Results** tab in the response. If you followed the course properly and pass all the Tests, you should see `Test Results (16/16)`:

    ![](https://whimuc.com/PwqrrQiv3tT4JsqRDkan2a/6UkSiA7gNb8j7m.png)

8. If you don't pass all the tests on the first try, you will see something like `Test Results (14/16)`. Don't worry, you can solve all the errors easily by reading the error messages and fixing all the erros. See the tips mentioned below:

    ![](https://whimuc.com/PwqrrQiv3tT4JsqRDkan2a/6n2s7wufz2wz5S.png)

**Tips to resolve all your errors**:
- **Read the test messages**. Use them as hints to fix your **Postman Library API v2 collection**. Save any changes you make, then send your test request again.
- **Re-read the instructions of previous lessons** carefully for the areas you missed.
- **Make sure your requests are in the order presented in the course!**
- **Keep trying**. Once your collection passes all the local tests, you have successfully completed the course halfway! Pat yourself on your back, and let's continue!
- If you still face problems, **check the [FAQ](https://academy.postman.com/page/postman-student-expert-frequently-asked-questions)** for common questions about how to resolve errors.
