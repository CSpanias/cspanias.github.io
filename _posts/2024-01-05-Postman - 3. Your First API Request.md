## Task: Create a workspace

The **Postman Library API v2** is a **REST API** that allows you to **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** books in a public library database. You will use **Postman** to interact with this API and manage books.

To start making Postman requests, you need to be inside a workspace:

1. **Workspaces** dropdown > **Create Workspace**:

    ![](https://everpath-course-content.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/instructor%2F26fp2261340y1ukokimvca8su%2Fpublic%2F1649272400%2Fworkspace-new.1649272400639.png){: .normal width="60%"}

2. Select **Blank Workspace** as Template:

3. Name your workspace "**Postman API Fundamentals Student Expert**" and set the visibility to **Public**. Then click **Create**:

4. Welcome to your empty new workspace!

    ![](https://everpath-course-content.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/instructor%2F26fp2261340y1ukokimvca8su%2Fpublic%2F1668980683%2Fse2.1668980683339.png)

## Task: Create a collection

**Collections** are places to organize your API requests in Postman. Let's make a new Collection in our workspace where our requests to the Postman Library API v2 will live.

1. From the left pane, either click the plus (`+`) icon or **Create a collection**:

    ![](https://everpath-course-content.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/instructor%2F26fp2261340y1ukokimvca8su%2Fpublic%2F1649279632%2Fnew-collection.1649279632240.png){: .normal width="60%"}

2. Name your collection "**Postman Library API v2**":

    ![](https://everpath-course-content.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/instructor%2F26fp2261340y1ukokimvca8su%2Fpublic%2F1649279747%2Fpostman-library-api-v2-collection-name.1649279747514.png){: .normal}


Next up, we will make our first API request.

## Task: Get books from the Library API

First things first: a librarian must know how to view all the books in the library catalog. According to the API documentation, you can get all the books in the library by making a request to `GET https://library-api.postmanlabs.com/books`. Here, `GET` is the **request method**, and the URL is the **request URL**.

### Make your first request

1. Create a new request by either clicking **Add a request** inside your new Collection or hovering on your Collection, then click the three dots icon and **Add request**:

    ![](https://everpath-course-content.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/instructor%2F26fp2261340y1ukokimvca8su%2Fpublic%2F1649281938%2Fadd+request.1649281938816.png){: .normal width="60%"}

2. Name your request "**get books**". Set the request method to `GET`, and the request URL to `GET https://library-api.postmanlabs.com/books`. Be sure to hit **Save your work using `CTRL + S`:

    ![](https://everpath-course-content.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/instructor%2F26fp2261340y1ukokimvca8su%2Fpublic%2F1649282885%2Fget+books.1649282885313.png){: .normal}

3. **Send** your request by clicking the Send button:

    ![](https://everpath-course-content.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/instructor%2F4qlhnpfiaeqby6zwhuhhmacvx%2Fpublic%2F1694444315%2FScreen+Recording+2023-09-11+at+8.23.56+PM.1694444314728.gif)

### View the response

If everything goes well, you will see a response from the server in the lower half of Postman. It should look like this: a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) response body with an **array** of book **objects**. You can scroll down to see more books:

### Request methods

When we make an HTTP call to a server, we specify a **request method** that indicates the type of operation we are about to perform, aka **HTTP verbs**. Some common HTTP request methods correspond to the **CRUD** operations mentioned earlier. You can see a list of more methods [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods).

| | |
|:-:|:-:|
| Method name | Operation |
| GET | Retrieve data (Read) |
| POST | Send data (Create) |
| PUT/PATCH	| Update data (Update) |
| DELETE | Delete data (Delete) |

> `PUT` usually replaces an entire resource, whereas `PATCH` usually is for partial updates.

Since we are "*getting*" books and not modifying any data, it makes sense that we are making a `GET` request. There are just conventions - it all depends on how the API is coded. To know which method to use, always read the API documentation you are working with, such as [Postman Library API v2 docs](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/15567703/UVyxRtng#a2f33f71-de38-42fb-97fe-dccac7516e73)!

### Request URL

In addition to a request method, a request must include a **request URL** that indicates *where* to make the API call. A request URL has three parts:
1. A **protocol** (such as `http://` or `https://`)
2. A **host** (server location)
3. A **path** (route on the server)

In **REST APIs**, the path often points to a reference entity, like "books".

| | | |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Protocol | Host | Path |
| https:// | library-api.postmanlabs.com | /books |

Paths and complete URLs are also sometimes called **API endpoints**.

### Reponse status codes

The Postman Library API v2 has returned a [**response status code**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status) of `200 OK`. Status codes are indicators of whether a request failed or succeeded. Status codes have conventions. For instance, any status code starting with `2xx` ("*a 200-level response*") represents a successful call. Some other categories are:

In Postman, you can hover over any response to see what it means:

## Request-Reponse pattern

Now you can understand the [request-response pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request%E2%80%93response), which represents how computers communicate over a network. An API is the interface that lets us know what kind of response to expect when we make certain calls to a server. You made an HTTP `GET` request to `https://library-api.postmanlabs.com/books` and received a response from the server:

![](https://everpath-course-content.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/instructor%2F26fp2261340y1ukokimvca8su%2Fpublic%2F1649285301%2Frequest+response+pattern.1649285301835.png){: .normal}

The **client** is the agent making a request. A client could be a browser or an app you have coded. In our case Postman is the client because that is how we sent the request. The **request** is sent over a network to some **server**. In our case, we made a request over the public internet to a server located at the address `https://library-api.postmanlabs.com`. The server interpreted the request (`GET /books`) and sent the appropriate **response** over the network back to the Postman client: a list of books.
