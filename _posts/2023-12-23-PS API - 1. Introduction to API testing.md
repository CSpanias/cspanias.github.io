## API recon

To start API testing, we first need to find out as much info about the API as possible, to discover its **attack surface**. To begin, we should identify **API endpoints**. These are locations where an API receives requests about a specific resource on its server. For example, consider the following `GET` request:

The API endpoint for this request is `/api/books`. This results in an interaction with the API to retrieve a list of books from a library. Another API endpoint might be, for instance, `/api/books/mystery`, which would retrieve a list of mystery books. 

Once we have identified the endpoints, we need to determine how to interact with them. This enables us to construct valid HTTP requests to test the API. For example, we should find out info about the following:
- The input data the API processes, including both compulsory and optional parameteres.
- The types of requests the API accepts, including supported HTTP methods and media formats.
- Rate limits and authentication mechanisms.
