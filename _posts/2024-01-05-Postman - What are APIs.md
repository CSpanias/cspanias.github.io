## What are APIs?

An **Application Programming Interface (API)** is a *contract that allows code to talk to other code*. APIs are the building blocks of modern software because they allow for sharing of resources and services across applications, organizations, and devices. 
- APIs help developers **integrate exciting features and build automation** without reinventing the wheel.
- APIs allow enterprises to **open up their product** for faster innovation.
- APIs **can be products themselves** (SaaS).

You can think of an APIs a being like **a waiter at a restaurant**, serving as a go-between for the customer and the kitchen. A customer who wants soup does not go into the kitchen to cook and they don't even have to know how to make it. The only have to know how to ask the waiter for soup, expecting the waiter to bring back soup.

APIs work the same way, but there are different names for the players involved:
