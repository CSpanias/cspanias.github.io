## How to prevent SQLi

We can prevent most instances of SQLi using **parameterized queries** instead of string concatenation within the query. These parameterized queries are also known as **prepared statements**. The following code is vulnerable to SQLi because the user input is concatenated directly into the query:

We can rewrite this code in a way that prevents the user input from interfering with the query structure:

We can use parameterized queries for any situation where untrusted input appears as data within the query, including the `WHERE` clause and values in an `INSERT` or `UPDATE` statement. They can't be used to handle untrusted input in other parts of the query, such as table or column names, or the `ORDER BY` clause. App functionality that places untrusted data into these parts of the query needs to take a different approach, such as:
- Whitelisting permitted input values.
- Using different logic to deliver the required behaviour.

For a parameterized query to be effective in preventing SQLi, **the string that is used in the query must always be a hard-coded constant**. It must never contain any variable data from any origin. We should not be tempted to decide case-by-case whether an item of data is trusted, and continue using string concatenation within the query for cases that are considered safe. It's easy to make a mistake about the possible origin of data, or for changes in other code to taint trusted data.
