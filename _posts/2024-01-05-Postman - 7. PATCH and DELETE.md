## Task: Checkout your book

Someone wants to checkout the book your just added! As a librarian, you will update the library database via the API to mark the book's `checkedOut` status from `false` to `true`. The [API documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/15567703/UVyxRtng#1c3ce860-e1ee-4957-b517-2e3068021abc) shows we can update a book by id by making a request (authorized with the API Key) with the updated info to: `PATCH https://library-api.postmanlabs.com/books/:id`.

### Make a request to update the book

1. Hover over your **Postman Library API v2** collection, click the three dots, select **Add request**, and name it **checkout a book**.
2. Set the request method to `PATCH`.
3. Set the request URL to: {{baseUrl}}/books/:id.
4. Set the value of the path variable `id` to {{id}}. This will use the value of our collection variable named `id` that was set in the **Test** script of the **add a book** request.

5. Add a **raw JSON** body in the **Body** tab to update the `checkedOut` property to `true`:

    ```json
    { 
    "checkedOut": true 
    }
    ```

6. **Save** and **Send** the request. You should get a `200 OK` response that shows the updated data about your book.

Now, if you return to your **get book by id** request, update the id path variable to {{id}}, **Save**, and **Send** the request, you will see the same updated data:

## Task: Delete your book

Oops! The person that checked out your book accidentally lost it...you will need to delete it from the library database. The API documentation shows how we can delete books with the `DELETE /books/:id path`.

### Make a new request

The `DELETE` request has a similar format to the `PATCH` request, so let's copy the `PATCH` request to make our new request.

1. Hover on your Collection, **Add request**, and name it **delete a book**.
2. Set the request method to `DELETE`.
3. Set the request URL to {{baseUrl}}/books/:id.
4. In the **Params** tab, make sure tha path variable id is set to {{id}}.
5. **Save** and **Send** your request. You should get a `204 No Content` response from the API. This means the server successfully deleted the book, and won't send any response body back.

### Is it really gone?

Without changing anything, try sending your request again. Since you are sending a request to delete a book with an id that no longer exists, you get a `404` error:
