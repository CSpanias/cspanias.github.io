## Task: Checkout your book

Someone wants to checkout the book your just added! As a librarian, you will update the library database via the API to mark the book's `checkedOut` status from `false` to `true`. The [API documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/15567703/UVyxRtng#1c3ce860-e1ee-4957-b517-2e3068021abc) shows we can update a book by id by making a request (authorized with the API Key) with the updated info to: `PATCH https://library-api.postmanlabs.com/books/:id`.
