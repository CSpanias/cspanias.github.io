## [Level 20 &rarr; 21](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit21.html)

> There is a `setuid` binary in the `home` directory that does the following: it makes a connection to `localhost` on the port you specify as a command-line argument. It then reads a line of text from the connection and compares it to the password in the previous level (`bandit20`). If the password is correct, it will transmit the password for the next level (`bandit21`).

> NOTE: Try connecting to your own network daemon to see if it works as you think.

```bash
$ ssh bandit20@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

We can create a **onetime server**, a server that sends one message and then disconnects, using `nc -lp` and then pass it a message with the combination of the `echo` command and the pipe (`|`) operator. We can background this operation using `&` at the end so we can continue to use our terminal instead of opening a new one:

```bash
bandit20@bandit:~$ echo -n 'VxCazJaVykI6W36BkBU0mJTCM8rR95XT' | nc -lp 1337 &
[1] 3062056
```

Now we need to run the binary using the same port as our server (`1337`) so it can connect to it, receive the password inputted through `echo`, and sends us back the new one:

```bash
bandit20@bandit:~$ ./suconnect 1337 VxCazJaVykI6W36BkBU0mJTCM8rR95XT
Read: VxCazJaVykI6W36BkBU0mJTCM8rR95XT
Password matches, sending next password

[1]+  Done                    echo -n 'VxCazJaVykI6W36BkBU0mJTCM8rR95XT' | nc -lp 1337
```

## [Level 21 &rarr; 22](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit22.html)

> A program is running automatically at regular intervals from `cron`, the time-based job scheduler. Look in `/etc/cron.d/` for the configuration and see what command is being executed.

```bash
$ ssh bandit21@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit22 > /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv
```

The above bash script modifies the permissions (`chmod 644`) of the `/tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv` file and then copies the next level's password to that file. The `644` permissions correspond to the owner of the file (`bandit22`) having read (`r`) and write (`w`) permissions and the group and others having read permissions only. As a result, everyone can read it. 

```bash
# check file's permissions
bandit21@bandit:/etc/cron.d$ ls -l /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv

## [Level 22 &rarr; 23](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit23.html)

> A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in `/etc/cron.d/` for the configuration and see what command is being executed.

> NOTE: Looking at shell scripts written by other people is a very useful skill. The script for this level is intentionally made easy to read. If you are having problems understanding what it does, try executing it to see the debug information it prints.

@reboot bandit23 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh  &> /dev/null
* * * * * bandit23 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh  &> /dev/null

bandit22@bandit:~$ cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh
#!/bin/bash

myname=$(whoami)
mytarget=$(echo I am user $myname | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1)

echo "Copying passwordfile /etc/bandit_pass/$myname to /tmp/$mytarget"

cat /etc/bandit_pass/$myname > /tmp/$mytarget
```

Let's break down what this bash script does:
1. `myname=$(whoami)` The `whoami` commands outputs the current user and since this is written by `bandit23`, the `myname` variable will be assigned that name.
2. `mytarget=$(echo I am user $myname | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1)` The first part just outputs 'I am user bandit23', the second part hashes that string using the MD5 hashing algorithm, and then third part splits the output using space as the delimiter and picks the first field. The latter is then assigned to the variable `mytarget`.
3. Then goes on to echo the following string: "Copying passwordfile /etc/bandit_pass/bandit23 to /tmp/<mytarget>".
4. Finally, it copies the password from `/etc/bandit_pass/bandit23` the a file under the `/tmp/` directory with the `mytarget`'s value as its name.

An example of what's happening:

```bash
# hashing the string using MD5
bandit22@bandit:~$ echo I am user bandit23 | md5sum
8ca319486bfbbc3663ea0fbe81326349  -

# selecting the first field of the output
bandit22@bandit:~$ echo I am user bandit23 | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1
8ca319486bfbbc3663ea0fbe81326349
```

So the password should be stored in the following file `/tmp/8ca319486bfbbc3663ea0fbe81326349`.

```bash
bandit22@bandit:~$ cat /tmp/8ca319486bfbbc3663ea0fbe81326349

## [Level 23 &rarr; 24](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit24.html)

> A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in `/etc/cron.d/` for the configuration and see what command is being executed.

> NOTE: This level requires you to create your own first shell-script. This is a very big step and you should be proud of yourself when you beat this level!

> NOTE 2: Keep in mind that your shell script is removed once executed, so you may want to keep a copy aroundâ€¦

```bash
$ ssh bandit23@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

bandit23@bandit:~$ cat /etc/cron.d/cronjob_bandit24
@reboot bandit24 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit24.sh &> /dev/null
* * * * * bandit24 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit24.sh &> /dev/null

bandit23@bandit:~$ cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit24.sh
#!/bin/bash

myname=$(whoami)

cd /var/spool/$myname/foo
echo "Executing and deleting all scripts in /var/spool/$myname/foo:"
for i in * .*;
do
    if [ "$i" != "." -a "$i" != ".." ];
    then
        echo "Handling $i"
        owner="$(stat --format "%U" ./$i)"
        if [ "${owner}" = "bandit23" ]; then
            timeout -s 9 60 ./$i
        fi
        rm -f ./$i
    fi
done
```

Let's break down what the above bash script does:

The `myname` variable is assigned the output of the command `whoami` typed by the user `bandin24`. 

```bash
bandit23@bandit:~$ whoami
bandit23
```

Then iterates through all files within the `/var/spool/bandit24/foo` directory, ignores the current (`.`) and previous (`..`) directories, and then checks who is the owner of the file.  

```bash
bandit23@bandit:/tmp$ stat --format "%U" test.txt
bandit23
```

  > [`stat` command in Linux](https://linuxize.com/post/stat-command-in-linux/).

Finally, if the owner is the user `bandint23`, it executes the script. If the scripts runs for more than 60 seconds, then it will be forcefully terminated. Finally, it deletes the script.

As a result, we have to create a script that reads `bandit24`'s password, move it to the `/var/spool/bandit24/foo/` directory, and wait for it to execute. According to the output of `/etc/cron.d/cronjob_bandit24`, it executes every minute, so it should be executed within maximum of 1 minute.

```bash
# create a new director within /tmp
bandit23@bandit:~$ mkdir /tmp/lvl_23/
# move to the newly-created dir
bandit23@bandit:~$ cd /tmp/lvl_23
# create the required script
bandit23@bandit:/tmp/lvl_23$ nano bandit23.sh
# display the script's content
bandit23@bandit:/tmp/lvl_23$ cat bandit23.sh
#!/bin/bash
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24 > /tmp/lvl_23/lvl_24_pass
# create the file that the password will be written to
bandit23@bandit:/tmp/lvl_23$ touch lvl_24_pass
# give appropriate permissions to the script, directory, and password file

## [Level 24 &rarr; 25](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit25.html)

> A daemon is listening on port `30002` and will give you the password for `bandit25` if given the password for `bandit24` and a secret numeric 4-digit pincode. There is no way to retrieve the pincode except by going through all of the 10000 combinations, called **brute-forcing**. You do not need to create new connections each time.

```bash
$ ssh bandit24@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

We can connect to the listening port using `nc`:

```bash
bandit24@bandit:/tmp/lvl_24$ nc localhost 30002
I am the pincode checker for user bandit25. Please enter the password for user bandit24 and the secret pincode on a single line, separated by a space.
# input the correct flag and a random 4-digit pincode
VAfGXJ1PBSsPSnvsjI8p759leLZ9GGar 0000
Wrong! Please enter the correct pincode. Try again.
```

Now we can create a brute-forcing script to get all the possible combinations. We can loop through all possible 4-digit combinations (`for i in {0000..9999}`), add each pin to the flag separated by a space (`echo "$password $i"`), and then append each sequence to a file (`>> pin_combinations.txt`). 

Passing the file as it is, i.e., with the 10000 resulting combinations, makes the connection to timeout, so we have to split it into 2 separate files (`split -l 5000 pin_combinations.txt pin_`). We can then pass each file to the daemon listening (`nc localhost 30002 < pin_aa > results_A` & `nc localhost 30002 < pin_ab >> results_A`), and search for a unique row in the final output (`sort results_A | uniq -u`):

```bash
bandit24@bandit:/tmp/lvl_24$ nano bruteForce.sh
bandit24@bandit:/tmp/lvl_23$ cat bruteForce.sh
#!/bin/bash

# set a variable with the previous level flag
password="VAfGXJ1PBSsPSnvsjI8p759leLZ9GGar"
# confirm the password
echo "The password is: $password."

echo "Creating the pin combination file..."
# iterate through all combinations of a 4-digit password
for i in {0000..9999}
do
        # append the password plus the pin combination separated by a space to a file
        echo "$password $i" >> pin_combinations.txt
done
echo "Done."

echo "Splitting the file into two..."
# split the file into 2 separate files
split -l 5000 pin_combinations.txt pin_
echo "Done."

echo "Brute-force starting...passing the first file..."
# pass the first file and write the results
nc localhost 30002 < pin_aa > results_A
echo "Done."

echo "Brute-force continues...passing the second file..."
# pass the second file and write the results
nc localhost 30002 < pin_ab >> results_A
echo "Done."

echo "Searching for the flag..."
# search for the flag
sort results_A | uniq -u
echo "Flag found!"
```

Now all we have to do, is execute our script:

```bash
# execute the script
bandit24@bandit:/tmp/lvl_23$ ./bruteForce.sh
The password is: VAfGXJ1PBSsPSnvsjI8p759leLZ9GGar.
Creating the pin combination file...
Done.
Splitting the file into two...
Done.
Brute-force starting...passing the first file...
Done.
Brute-force continues...passing the second file...
Done.
Searching for the flag...

Correct!
Exiting.
The password of user bandit25 is p7TaowMYrmu23Ol8hiZh9UvD0O9hpx8d
Timeout. Exiting.
Flag found!
```

-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
```

First, since there is a private key lying around, let's copy and paste it to our machine since we will use to log in to the next level:

```bash
# check file's content
$ head -5 id_rsa
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
MIIEpQIBAAKCAQEApis2AuoooEqeYWamtwX2k5z9uU1Afl2F8VyXQqbv/LTrIwdW

# assign the appropriate permissions to the file
$ sudo chmod 400 id_rsa
# check file's permissions
$ ls -l id_rsa
-r-------- 1 root root 1679 Jan  5 06:56 id_rsa
```

Then going back to our SSH connection, we can check which shell is assigned to each user by checking the `/etc/passwd` file:

```bash
# check users' assigned shells
bandit25@bandit:~$ cat /etc/passwd | grep 'bandit25\|bandit26'
bandit25:x:11025:11025:bandit level 25:/home/bandit25:/bin/bash
bandit26:x:11026:11026:bandit level 26:/home/bandit26:/usr/bin/showtext
# check file's content
bandit25@bandit:~$ cat /usr/bin/showtext
#!/bin/sh

export TERM=linux

exec more ~/text.txt
exit 0
```

For the user `bandit26` a script called `showtext` is assigned as a shell, which opens the `text.txt` file using `more`. [`more`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/more) is used to view large text files, displaying one screen at a time. Its **interactive mode** only works when the file's content is too large to fully be displayed in the current terminal window and it is based on the `vi` text editor.

As this level's instructions say, we must find a way to break out of `more`. From playing many fullpwn CTFs and constantly using [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/vi/#shell), we know that commands can be passed to `vi` and it can be used to break out from restricted environments by spawing an interactive system shell:

![](gtfobins_vi.png){: .normal}

As a result, we can try limiting our terminal's display for `more`'s interactive mode to work, and then spawn a shell through `vi` (using option (b)):

![](level_25_to_26.png){: .normal}

```bash
# connect as bandit26 to SSH
$ sudo ssh bandit26@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -i id_rsa -p 2220
```

After logging in we are in `vi`'s command mode:

![](more_login.png){: .normal}

Now, we can press `v` to go into `vi` and follow GTFOBins instructions:

```bash
# set the user's shell to /bin/bash
:set shell=/bin/bash
# drop into the above-defined shell
:shell
bandit26@bandit:~$
```

Now, we can just read the password of `bandit26` and proceed to the next level:

```bash
bandit26@bandit:~$ cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit26
c7GvcKlw9mC7aUQaPx7nwFstuAIBw1o1
```

## [Level 26 &rarr; 27](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit27.html)

> Good job getting a shell! Now hurry and grab the password for `bandit27`!

To get the password for `bandit27`, we have to login using the solution of the previous level. Once we reach the point that we have dropped on a shell we can see what's within the user's home directory:

```bash
# list directory's files
bandit26@bandit:~$ ls
bandit27-do  text.txt
# use the provided binary to read next level's password
bandit26@bandit:~$ ./bandit27-do
Run a command as another user.

We can interact with this repository as it was ours and we can use all `git` commands on it. We can see the logs as follows:

```

From the above output we notice the following:
1. The first commit was the creation of the `README.md` file.
2. The second one has as comment "*add missing data*" so this is when `Morla` probably wrote the credentials.
3. The thild and last commit has as comment "*fix info leak*" which is problably when the plaintext password was changed to its current form, i.e., `xxxxxxxxxx`.

So we can find the second commit and get the plaintext password:

```bash

```

After checking both logs, it does not seem that they include anything of interest. The `README.md` file mentioned "*no password in production!*" which suggests that there might be more than one branch, a development one and a production one. We can list all branches as follows:

```bash
# list branches
bandit29@bandit:/tmp/lvl_29/repo$ git branch -a
* master
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
  remotes/origin/dev
  remotes/origin/master
  remotes/origin/sploits-dev
```

There is indeed a development branch (`dev`), so we can switch to it and check what's in there:

```bash
# switch to the dev branch
bandit29@bandit:/tmp/lvl_29/repo$ git checkout dev
Branch 'dev' set up to track remote branch 'dev' from 'origin'.

Like most VCSs, Git has the ability to **tag** specific points in a repositoryâ€™s history as being important. Typically, people use this functionality to mark release points (v1.0, v2.0 and so on).

This time your task is to push a file to the remote repository.

Details:
    File name: key.txt
    Content: 'May I come in?'
    Branch: master
```

According to the `README.md` file, we will need to create a file meetings the required specifications and then push it to the repo. 

```bash
# create the file
bandit31@bandit:/tmp/lvl_31/repo$ echo "May I come in?" > key.txt
# check that the file is created
bandit31@bandit:/tmp/lvl_31/repo$ ls -la

# display file's content
bandit31@bandit:/tmp/lvl_31/repo$ cat key.txt
May I come in?
```

The sequence for pushing a file to a Git repo is:
1. Record changes to the repo via [`git commit`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit).
2. Update remote refs along with associated object via [`git push`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push).

Before doing that, we can see that there is a [`.gitignore`](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) file in our directory:

```bash
# display file's content
bandit31@bandit:/tmp/lvl_31/repo$ cat .gitignore
*.txt
```

`.gitignore` specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore. In this case, it ignores all `.txt` files (`*.txt`). So trying to go over the above 2-step sequence won't work in this case.

To add the file anyway we can use [`git add`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-add), which add file contents to the index, before using `git commit`:

```bash
# add file contents to the index
bandit31@bandit:/tmp/lvl_31/repo$ git add -f key.txt
# record the changes to the repo
bandit31@bandit:/tmp/lvl_31/repo$ git commit -a

WELCOME TO THE UPPERCASE SHELL
>> ls
sh: 1: LS: Permission denied
```

It seems that everything we type is automatically converted to uppercase! All the Linux commands are lowercase, so we can't really pass any command. But we can use [environment variables](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-set-and-list-environment-variables-in-linux/) which, by convention, have uppercase names.

More specifically, there is the [`$0`](https://linuxhandbook.com/bash-dollar-0/) special variable which can be used in two ways:
1. To find the logged-in shell.
2. To print the name of the script that is being executed.

We are interested in the first use!

```bash
# drop into the logged-in shell
>> $0
# read the password
$ cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit33
