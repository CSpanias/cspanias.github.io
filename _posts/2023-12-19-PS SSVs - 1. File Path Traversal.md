## Path traversal

A path, aka directory or dot-dot-slash, vulneratibility enables the attacker to access (read or write) arbitrary files on the application server.


1. Let's say that a shopping app displays images loading this HTML code:

    ```html
    <img src="/loadImage?filename=218.png">
    ```

    The `loadImage` URL takes a `filename` parameter and returns the contents of `218.png`. The image is stored under `/var/www/images`, so it is essentially calling `/var/www/images/218.png`.

2. We can use `../` to navigate directories and requeste any file we want from other directories:

    ```html
    https://insecure-website.com/loadImage?filename=../../../etc/passwd
    ```

    This translates to `/var/www/images/../../../etc/passwd`. 

    > On Windows, both `../` and `..\` are valid. 

## Lab: File path traversal, simple case

**Objective**: _This lab contains a path traversal vulnerability in the display of product images. To solve the lab, retrieve the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file._

1. It seems we are dealing with an e-shop:

    ![](dir_tra_home.png)

2. We can click on a product and examine the traffic with Burp, but first we need to whitelist images via our filter settings:

    ![](dir_tra_filter_settings.png){: .normal}

    ![](dir_tra_filter_settings_2.png)

3. We can now examine the request via Burp Proxy's HTTP History by refreshing the page. There we can see a GET request to the `/image` URL which takes the `filename` parameter:

    ![](dir_tra_request_image.png){: .normal}

4. We can send it to the Repeater and try our Path Traversal attack:

    ![](dir_tra_repeater.png)

8. To mark this lab as `solved`, we need to actually intercept the request via Proxy, modify it, and Forward it:

    ![](dir_tra_intercept.png){: .normal}

    ![](dir_tra_intercept_forward.png){: .normal}

    ![](dir_tra_solved.png)
