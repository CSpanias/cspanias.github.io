> _**Request Baskets** is a web service designed to capture arbitrary HTTP requests and facilitate their inspection through either a RESTful API or a straightforward web user interface._
>
> *[CVE-2023-27163](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-27163) represents a critical **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability** that was identified in Request-Baskets, affecting all versions up to and including 1.2.1. This particular vulnerability grants malicious actors the ability to gain unauthorized access to network resources and sensitive information by exploiting the `/api/baskets/{name}` component through carefully crafted API requests.*
>
> *As previously mentioned, Request-Baskets operates as a web application designed to collect and log incoming HTTP requests directed to specific endpoints known as “baskets.” During the creation of these baskets, users have the flexibility to specify alternative servers to which these requests should be forwarded. **The critical issue here lies in the fact that users can inadvertently specify services they shouldn’t have access to, including those typically restricted within a network environment**.*
>
> *For example, consider a scenario where the server hosts Request-Baskets on port 55555 and simultaneously runs a Flask web server on port 8000. The Flask server, however, is configured to exclusively interact with the localhost. In this context, an attacker can exploit the SSRF vulnerability by creating a basket that forwards requests to http://localhost:8000, effectively bypassing the previous network restrictions and gaining access to the Flask web server, which should have been restricted to local access only.*

## 3. Privilege Escalation

```shell
# checking perms
puma@sau:~$ sudo -l
sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for puma on sau:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User puma may run the following commands on sau:
    (ALL : ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/systemctl status trail.service
```

> `sudo systemctl status [service]` [privilege escalation](https://exploit-notes.hdks.org/exploit/linux/privilege-escalation/sudo/sudo-systemctl-privilege-escalation/#spawn-shell-in-the-pager).

```shell
