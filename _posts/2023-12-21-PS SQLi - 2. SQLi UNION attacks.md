## SQLi UNION attacks

When an app is vulnerable to SQLi and the results of the query are returned within the app's responses, we can use the `UNION` keyword to retrieve data from other tables within the database. This keyword enables us to execute one or more additional `SELECT` statements and append the results to the original query. For example:

```sql
SELECT a, b FROM table1 UNION SELECT c, d FROM table2
```

For this to work, two key requirements must be met:
1. The individual queries must return the same number of columns.
2. The data types in each column must be compatible between the individual queries.

As a result, to carry out an SQLi UNION attack, we should find out:
1. How many columns are being returned from the original query.
2. Which columns returned from the original query are of a suitable data type to hold the results from the injected query.

## Determining the number of columns required

There are two effective methods to determine the number of columns returned from the original query:
1. Injecting a series of `ORDER BY` clauses and incrementing the specified column index until an error occurs. 

    For example, if the injection point is a quoted string within the `WHERE` clause of the original query:

    ![](union_orderby_payloads.png){: .normal}

    The column in an `ORDER BY` clause can be specified by its index, so we don't need to know the names of any columns. When the specified column index exceeds the number of actual columns in the result set, the database returns an error, such as:

    `The ORDER BY position number 3 is out of range of the number of items in the select list.`

    The app might actually return the database error in its HTTP response, but it may also issue a generic error response. In other cases, it may simply return no results at all. Either way, as long as we can detect some differece in the response, we can infer the number of columns.

2. Submitting a series of `UNION SELECT` payloads specifying a different number of null values:

    ![](union_unionselect_payloads.png){: .normal}

    If the number of nulls does not match the number of columns, the database returns an error, such as:

    `All queries combined using a UNION, INTERSECT or EXCEPT operator must have an equal number of expressions in their target lists.`

    We use `NULL` as the values returned from the injected `SELECT` query because the data types in each column must be compatible between the original and the injeceted queries. `NULL` is convertible to every common data type, so it maximizes the chance that the payload will succeed when the column count is correct. As with the `ORDER BY` technique, the app might actually return the database error in its HTTP response, but many return a generic error or no results. 
    
    When the number of nulls matches the number of columns, the database returns an additional row in the result set, containing null values in each column. The effect on the HTTP response depends on the app's code. If we are lucky, we will see some additional content within the response, such as an extra row on an HTML table. Otherwise, the null values might trigger a different error, such as a `NullPointerException`. In the worst case, the response might look the same as a response caused by an incorrect number of nulls.

### Lab: SQL injection UNION attack, determining the number of columns returned by the query

**Objective**: _This lab contains a SQLi vulnerability in the product category filter. The results from the query are returned in the application's response, so you can use a `UNION` attack to retrieve data from other tables. The first step of such an attack is to determine the number of columns that are being returned by the query. You will then use this technique in subsequent labs to construct the full attack. To solve the lab, determine the number of columns returned by the query by performing a SQLi UNION attack that returns an additional row containing null values._
