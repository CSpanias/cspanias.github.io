## SQLi UNION attacks

When an app is vulnerable to SQLi and the results of the query are returned within the app's responses, we can use the `UNION` keyword to retrieve data from other tables within the database. This keyword enables us to execute one or more additional `SELECT` statements and append the results to the original query. For example:

```sql
SELECT a, b FROM table1 UNION SELECT c, d FROM table2
```

For this to work, two key requirements must be met:
1. The individual queries must return the same number of columns.
2. The data types in each column must be compatible between the individual queries.

As a result, to carry out an SQLi UNION attack, we should find out:
1. How many columns are being returned from the original query.
2. Which columns returned from the original query are of a suitable data type to hold the results from the injected query.

## Determining the number of columns required

There are two effective methods to determine the number of columns returned from the original query:
1. Injecting a series of `ORDER BY` clauses and incrementing the specified column index until an error occurs. 

    For example, if the injection point is a quoted string within the `WHERE` clause of the original query:

    ![](union_orderby_payloads.png){: .normal}

    The column in an `ORDER BY` clause can be specified by its index, so we don't need to know the names of any columns. When the specified column index exceeds the number of actual columns in the result set, the database returns an error, such as:

    `The ORDER BY position number 3 is out of range of the number of items in the select list.`

    The app might actually return the database error in its HTTP response, but it may also issue a generic error response. In other cases, it may simply return no results at all. Either way, as long as we can detect some differece in the response, we can infer the number of columns.

2. Submitting a series of `UNION SELECT` payloads specifying a different number of null values:

    ![](union_unionselect_payloads.png){: .normal}

    If the number of nulls does not match the number of columns, the database returns an error, such as:

    `All queries combined using a UNION, INTERSECT or EXCEPT operator must have an equal number of expressions in their target lists.`

    We use `NULL` as the values returned from the injected `SELECT` query because the data types in each column must be compatible between the original and the injeceted queries. `NULL` is convertible to every common data type, so it maximizes the chance that the payload will succeed when the column count is correct. As with the `ORDER BY` technique, the app might actually return the database error in its HTTP response, but many return a generic error or no results. 
    
    When the number of nulls matches the number of columns, the database returns an additional row in the result set, containing null values in each column. The effect on the HTTP response depends on the app's code. If we are lucky, we will see some additional content within the response, such as an extra row on an HTML table. Otherwise, the null values might trigger a different error, such as a `NullPointerException`. In the worst case, the response might look the same as a response caused by an incorrect number of nulls.

### Lab: SQL injection UNION attack, determining the number of columns returned by the query

> **Objective**: _This lab contains a SQLi vulnerability in the product category filter. The results from the query are returned in the application's response, so you can use a `UNION` attack to retrieve data from other tables. The first step of such an attack is to determine the number of columns that are being returned by the query. You will then use this technique in subsequent labs to construct the full attack. To solve the lab, determine the number of columns returned by the query by performing a SQLi UNION attack that returns an additional row containing null values._

1. The site provides an option to filter products based on category:

    ![](lab1_home.png){: width="60%" .normal}

2. We can test for an SQLi vulnerability by inserting a single quote character:

    ![](lab1_sqli_test_burp.png)

3. Our goal is to determine the number of columns returned by the original query, so we can use an `ORDER BY` clause and increment its index until we get an error:

    ![](lab1_orderby1_burp.png)

    ![](lab1_orderby4_burp.png)

4. Since we got an error on the fourth index, we can infer that the number of colums are three and use a `UNION` attack to solve the lab:

    ![](lab1_solved_burp.png)

    ![](lab1_solved.png)

## Database-specific syntax

On Oracle, every `SELECT` query must use the `FROM` keyword and specify a valid table. There is a built-in table on Oracle called `dual` which can be used for this purpose. So the injected queries on Orance would need to look like:

![](oracle_payload.png)

The payloads described use the `--` to comment out the remainder of the original query following the injection point. On MySQL, the `--` must be followed by a space, `-- `. Alternatively, the `#` character can be used to identify a comment.

## Finding columns with a useful data type

The interesting data that we want to retrieve is usually in string form. This means that we need to find one or more columns in the original query whose data type is, or is compatible with, string data.

After we determine the number of columns, we can probe each one to test whether it can hold string data. We can submit a series of `UNION SELECT` payloads that place a string value into each column in turn. For example, if the query returnes four columns, we would submit:

![](slqi_data_type_payloads.png)

If the column data is not compatible with strings, the injected query will cause a database error, such as:

`Conversion failed when converting the varchar value 'a' to data type int.`

If an error does not occur, and the app's response contains some additional content including the injected string value, then the relevant column is suitable for retrieving string data.

### Lab: SQL injection UNION attack, finding a column containing text

> **Objective**: _This lab contains a SQLi vulnerability in the product category filter. The results from the query are returned in the application's response, so you can use a UNION attack to retrieve data from other tables. To construct such an attack, you first need to determine the number of columns returned by the query. You can do this using a technique you learned in a previous lab. The next step is to identify a column that is compatible with string data. The lab will provide a random value that you need to make appear within the query results. To solve the lab, perform a SQL injection UNION attack that returns an additional row containing the value provided. This technique helps you determine which columns are compatible with string data._

1. Upon visiting the site, we can see the string that is required to inject for our SQLi attack, i.e., `O35Psr`:

    ![](lab2_home.png)

2. We can first find out the number of columns that the original query returns using `ORDER BY`:

    ![](lab2_orderby4.png)

3. Since we got an error at four, we can infer that it returns three columns. Now, we must discover which field is compatible with string data by injecting the specified payload into one of the three columns, until it works:

    ![](lab2_datatype_pos1.png)

    ![](lab2_datatype_pos2.png)

    ![](lab2_solved.png)
