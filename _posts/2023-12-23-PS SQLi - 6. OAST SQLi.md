## Exploiting blind SQLi using out-of-band (OAST) techniques

An app might carry out a SLQ query asynchronously. The app continues processing the user's request in the original thread, and uses another thread to execute a SQL query using the tracking cookie. They query is still vulnerable to SQLi, but none of the techniques described so far will work. The app's response does not depend on the [query returning any data](https://cspanias.github.io/posts/PS-SQLi-3.-Blind-SQLi/), [error messages](https://cspanias.github.io/posts/PS-SQLi-4.-Error-based-SQLi/), or on the [time taken to execute the query]().
