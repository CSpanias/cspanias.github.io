## Server-side parameter pollution (SSPP)

Some systems contain internal APIs that aren't directly accessible from the internet. **SSPP**, aka **HTTP parameter pollution**, occurs when a website embeds user input in a server-side request to an internal API without adequate encoding. This means that an attacker may be able to manipulate or inject params, which may enable them to:
- Override existing params.
- Modify the app's behavior.
- Access unauthorized data.

We can test any user input for any kind of parameter pollution: query-parameters, form fields, headers, and URL path parameters.

## Testing for SSPP in the query string

To test for SSPP in the query string, we can place syntax characters, such as `#`, `&`, and `=`, in our input and observe how the app responds. Consider a vulnerable app that enables us to search for other users based on their username. When we search for a user, our browser makes the following request: `GET /userSearch?name=peter&back=/home`. To retrieve user info, the server queries an internal API with the following request: `GET /users/search?name=peter&publicProfile=true`.

## Truncating query strings

We can use a URL-encoded `#` character to attempt to truncate the server-side request. To help us interpret the response, we could also add a string after the `#` character. For instance, we could modify the query as follows: `GET /userSearch?name=peter%23foo&back=/home`. The front-end will try to access the following URL: `GET /users/search?name=peter#foo&publicProfile=true`.

> It is essential that we URL-encode the `#` character. Otherwise, the front-end app will interpret it as a fragment identifier and it won't be passed to the internal API.

We can then review the response for clues about whether the query has been truncated. For example, if the response returns the user `peter`, the server-side query may have been truncated. If an `Invalid name` error message is returned, the app may have treated `foo` as part of the username. This suggests that the server-side request many not have been truncated. 

If we are able to truncate the server-side request, this removes the requirement for the `publicProfile` field to be set to `true`. We may be able to exploit this to return non-public user profiles.

## Injecting invalid parameters

We can use an URL-encoded `&` character to attempt to add a second parameter to the server-side request. For example, we could modify the query string as follows: `GET /userSearch?name=peter%26foo=xyz&back=/home`. This would result in the following server-side request to the internal API: `GET /users/search?name=peter&foo=xyz&publicProfile=true`.

We should then review the response for clues about how the additional parameter is parsed. For instance, if the response is unchanged this may indicate that the parameter was successfully injected but ignored by the app. To build up a more complete picture, we will need to test further.

## Injecting valid parameters

If we are able to modify the query string, we can then attempt to add a second valid parameter to the server-side request. For example, if we have identified the `email` parameter, we could add it to the query string: `GET /userSearch?name=peter%26email=foo&back=/home`. This will result in the following server-side request to the internal API: `GET /users/search?name=peter&email=foo&publicProfile=true`.

Again, we should then review the response for clues about how the additional parameter is parsed.

## Overriding existing parameters

To confirm whether the app is vulnerable to SSPP, we could try to override the original parameter. We can do this by injecting a second parameter with the same name: `GET /userSearch?name=peter%26name=carlos&back=/home`. This will be translated to the following server-side request to the internal API: `GET /users/search?name=peter&name=carlos&publicProfile=true`.

The internal API interprets two `name` parameters. The impact of this depends on how the app processes the second parameter. This varies across different web technologies:
- **PHP parses the last parameter only**. This would result in a user search for `carlos`.
- **ASP.NET combines both parameters**. This would result in a user search for `peter,carlos`, which might result in an `Invalid username` error message.
- **Node.js/express parses the first parameter only**. This would result in a user search for `peter`, giving an unchanged result.

If we are able to override the original parameter, we may be able to conduct an exploit. For instance, we could add `name=administrator` to the request which may enable us to log in as the user `administrator`.

## Lab: Exploiting server-side parameter pollution in a query string

> **Objective**: _To solve the lab, log in as the `administrator` and delete `carlos`._

1. On the site, there is a *Forgot password* functionality. Let's use this for the `administrator` account:

    ![](lab1_forgot_pass.png){: width="60%" .normal}

    ![](lab1_admin_reset.png){: width="70%" .normal}

    ![](lab1_check_email.png){: width="80%" .normal}

2. If we check Burp Proxy's HTTP history, there is a `POST` request to `/forgot-password`:

    ![](lab1_forgot_burp.png)

3. We can start playing around with the request's parameters and examine its responses. For example, we can change `username`'s value:

    ![](lab1_adminx_burp.png)

4. We got an `Invalid username` error message, so let's try something else, such as adding a second parameter using a URL-encoded `&`:

    ![](lab1_add_param.png)

5. This time we got a `Parameter is not supported` error message. This suggests that the internal API may have interpreted `&x=y` as a separate parameter, instead of part of the username. We can also try to truncate the request using a URL-encoded `#`:

    ![](lab1_truncated.png)

6. We now got a `Field not specified` error message, which indicates that the server-side query may include an additional parameter called `field`, which has been removed by the `#` character. We can try and add `field` back:

    ![](lab1_field.png)

7. The `Invalid field` error message suggests that the server-side request app may recognize the injected `field` parameter. We now need to brute-force its value:

    ![](lab1_intruder_payload.png){: width="70%" .normal}

    ![](lab1_intruder_results.png){: width="70%" .normal}

8. We notice that both the `username` and `email` strings seem to be valid values for the `field` parameter based on the response status code, i.e. `200`:

    ![](lab1_field_username.png)

    ![](lab1_field_email.png)

9. In Proxy's HTTP history there is a JavaScript file containing an endpoint with the parameter `reset_token`:

    ![](lab1_js_resetToken.png)

10. If we change the value of the `field` parameter to `reset_token` we will see that the response includes a password reset token:

    ![](lab1_pass_token.png)

11. If we use the `reset_token` endpoint and pass as its value the token we just got, we will be able to change `administrator`'s password:

    ![](lab1_reset_admin_pass.png)

12. We can now login as `administrator` and delete `carlos`:

    ![](lab1_delete_carlos.png)

## Testing for SSPP in REST paths

A RESTful API may place parameter names and values in the URL path, rather than the query string. For example, consider the following path: `/api/users/123`. The URL path might be broken down as follows:
- `/api` is the root API endpoint.
- `/users` represents a resource, in this case `users`.
- `/123` represents a parameter, here an identifier for the specific user.

Consider an app that enables us to edit user profiles based on their username. Requests are sent to the following endpoint: `GET /edit_profile.php?name=peter`. This results in the following server-side request: `GET /api/private/users/peter`. An attacker may be able to manipulate server-side URL path parameters to exploit the API.

To test for this vulnerability, add **path traversal sequences** to modify parameters and observe how the app responds. We could submit URL-encoded `peter/../admin` as the value of the `name` parameter: `GET /edit_profile.php?name=peter%2f..%2fadmin`, which may result in the following server-side request: `GET /api/private/users/peter/../admin`.

If the server-side client or back-end API normalize this path, it may be resolved to `/api/private/users/admin`.

## Testing for SSPP in structured data formats

An attacker may be able to manipulate parameters to exploit vulnerabilities in the server's processing of other structured data formats, such as JSON or XML. To test for this, we can inject unexpected structured data into user inputs and see how the server responds.

Consider an app that enables users to edit their profile, then applies their changes with a request to a server-side API. When we edit our name, our browser makes the following request:

![](sspp_structured.png)

This results in the following server-side request:

![](sspp_structured_1.png)

We can attempt to add thet `access_level` parameter to the request as follows:

![](sspp_structured_2.png)

If the user input is added to the server-side JSON data without adequate validation or sanitization, this results in the following server-side request:

![](sspp_structured_3.png)

This may result in the user `peter` having administrator privileges. Consider a similar example, but where the client-side user input is in JSOn data. When we edit our name, our browser makes the follwoing request:

!(sspp_structured_ex2.png)

This results in the following server-side request:

![](sspp_structured_1.png)

We can attempt to add thet `access_level` parameter to the request as follows:

![](sspp_structured_1_ex2.png)

If the user input is decoded and then added to ther server-side JSON data without adequate encoding, this results in the following server-side request:

![](sspp_structured_2_ex2.png)

Again, this may result in `peter` having elevated privileges. 

**Structured format injection can also occur in responses**. For example, this can occur if user input is stored securely in a database and then embedded into a JSON response from a back-end API without adequate encoding. We can usually detect and exploit structured fromat injection in responses in the same way you can in requests.

## Testing with automated tools

**Burp Scanner** automatically detects suspicious input transformations when performing an audit. These occur when an app receives user input, transforms it in some way and then performs further processing on the result. This behavior does not necessarily constitute a vulnerability, so we will need to do further testing using the aforementioned manual techniques. 

We can also use the **Backlash Powered Scanner BApp** to identify server-side injection vulnerabilities. The scanner classifies inputs as *boring*, *interesting*, or *vulnerable*. We will need to investigate interesting inputs using the manual techniques outlined above.

## Preventing SSPP

To prevent SSPP, we can use an **allowlist** to define characters that don't need encoding, and make sure all other user input is encoded before it's included in a server-side request. We should also make sure that all input adheres to the expected format and structure.
