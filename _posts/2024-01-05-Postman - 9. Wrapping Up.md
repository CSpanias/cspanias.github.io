## Skillcheck (required)

To complete this test, we will switch gears and pretend to call a Movie API. You will make a request that adds data to a movie database. Once you finish making the request, you will check your API skills by testing your entire API Fundamentals Student Expert collection in Postman.

### One API call and 6 tasks! Your goals is to pass all the tests.

A movie theater uses an API to poll people on their favorite movie actors. Your job is to build a request to submit your favorite actor from a movie of your choice to their database. After making your request, you will check your skills by sending your entire collection for testing in Postman. 

### Task 1: Make the request

Make a request named "**skill check**" and add it under the **delete a book** request in your collection:

We will mimic a request to the movie theater using the [Postman Echo API](https://learning.postman.com/docs/developer/echo-api/), which is a special API Postman built that allows you to make a request the returns whatever you send it. Make your **skill check** request a `POST` method to this endpoint: `https://postman-echo.com/post`.

### Task 2: Add a query parameter called "movieName"

Your request should have: a `movieName` parameter with a value set to your favorite movie.

### Task 3: Turn your base URL into a variable

Simplify the request by replacing `https://postman-echo.com/post` with a collection variable named `skillcheckBaseUrl`.

### Task 4: Use API Key authorization

The movie theater API requires all requests to be authorized. Add an API key of `student-expert` and a value of `skillcheck` at the request level (not the collection level).

### Task 5: Add a JSON body with the property "actorName"

Your skill check request should be a JSON body with a property called `actorName` and a value set to any actor from the movie you chose in step 2. Send your request to get a response from the API.

### Task 6: Set a variable using a test script

Let's automatically set the `actorName` as a collection variable named `favoriteActor`. In the **Tests** tab of the request, write a script to get the `actorName` from the response body and save the value as a new collection variable called `favoriteActor`. Send your request again and confirm this works by checking your collection variable page to see if the value is updated.

## Test your collection locally

Nice! You made your request! Now, you'll test your entire API Fundamentals Student Expert collection using the "Collection Test" collection we forked earlier. If you missed it or did not fork the collection, please revisit the "Halfway Test" lesson. Follow the instructions below to make the final test.

1. Save the **Postman Library API v2 collection** collection after adding all the requests until the skill check. It should look like this:

    ![](https://whimuc.com/PwqrrQiv3tT4JsqRDkan2a/834wPPT4DdTgjX.png){: .normal}

    > Your collection should look like this in the exact same order. If your requests are out of order, you can drag them into the above order.

2. You already set the variable `{{submission}}` in the Halfway Test lesson.

3. Let's ensure that the `{{submission}}` variable is set before we test our collection; please follow this quick step:

4. Go to the Final Check request in the "Collection Test" collection and run the request:

5. Check the Test Results tab in the response. If you followed the course properly and passed all the Tests, you should see `Test Results (28/28)`.

## Submit your Postman collection

1. Click on the **submit request** in your **Collection Test** collection.

    ![](https://whimuc.com/PwqrrQiv3tT4JsqRDkan2a/Amf1KeYYJ3xbqT.png){: .normal}

2.  Ensure that the request method is set to `POST`, and the request URL to `https://lesson-completion.postmanlabs.com/submit`.

3. Add a **raw JSON body** to your request from the **Body** tab:

    ```json
    {
    "email": "charalampos.spanias@ou.ac.uk",
    "postmanCollectionJsonUrl": "{{submission}}",
    "publishedCourseId": "2q2jokzsn62y8",
    "lessonId": "go6mgkytvk8u"
    }
    ```

4. **Save** and **Submit** your request. If your collection passes all the tests, you will get a success message, and this lesson will be marked complete automatically ðŸŽ‰ !

### Stuck?

If you get a `424` error response from the API, your collection failed one or more tests. Follow these steps. 

1. **Fix the errors, save, and resubmit**: Read the error messages and make any necessary fixes to your collection to pass the tests. Be sure to save any changes! 

2. **Getting a 500 level error?**: Try resubmitting again in 5 minutes. If that fails, try step 3 below.

3. **Check the [FAQ](https://academy.postman.com/page/postman-student-expert-frequently-asked-questions) for common questions about how to resolve errors**.

4. **Contact us**: If the issue persists after you have checked the FAQ and fixed your errors, saved and updated your collection, or if you are getting a 500-level error response, contact studentprogram@postman.com with your collection ID and a screenshot of your request and error message.
