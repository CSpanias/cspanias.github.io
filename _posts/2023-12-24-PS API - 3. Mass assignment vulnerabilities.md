## Mass assignment vulnerabilities

**Mass assignment**, aka **auto-binding**, can inadvertently create hidden parameters. It occurs when software frameworks automatically bind request parameters to fields on an internal object. Auto-binding may therefore result in the app supporting parameters that were never intended to be processed by the developer.

## Identifying hidden parameters

Since auto-binding creates params from object fields, we can often identify these by manually examining object returned by the API. For example, consider a `PATCH /api/users/` request, which enables users to update their username and email, and includes the following JSON:

```json
{
    "username": "wiener",
    "email": "wiener@example.com",
}
```

A concurrent `GET /api/users/123` request returns the following JSON:

```json
{
    "id": 123,
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "isAdmin": "false",
}
```

This may indicate that the hidden `id` and `isAdmin` params are bound to the internet user object, alongside the updated `username` and `email` params.

## Testing auto-binding vulnerabilities

We can test if we can modify the enumerated `isAdmin` param value by adding it to the `PATCH` request:

```json
{
    "username": "wiener",
    "email": "wiener@example.com",
    "isAdmin": false,
}
```

In addition, we can send a `PATCH` request with an invalid `isAdmin` param value:

```json
{
    "username": "wiener",
    "email": "wiener@example.com",
    "isAdmin": "foo",
}
```

If the app behaves differently, this may suggest that the invalid value impacts the query logic, but the valid value does not, which in turn, may indicate that the parm can be successfully updated by the user. We can send the `PATCH` request with `isAdmin` param value set to `true`, to try and exploit the vulnerability:

```json
{
    "username": "wiener",
    "email": "wiener@example.com",
    "isAdmin": true,
}
```

If the `isAdmin` value in the request is bound to the user object without adequate validation and sanitization, the user `wiener` may be incorrectly granted admin privileges. To determine if this is the case, we can browse the app as `wiener` to see whether we can access admin functionality.

### Lab: Exploiting a mass assignment vulnerability

> **Objective**: _To solve the lab, find and exploit a mass assignment vulnerability to buy a Lightweight l33t Leather Jacket. You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: `wiener:peter`._

1. When we log in as `wiener` we can see the item's initial price:

    ![](lab1_initial_price.png)

2. If we add the jacket to our cart, go to checkout and place our order, we will notice that there is both a `GET` and a `POST` request to the `/api/checkout` endpoint:

    ![](lab1_cart.png)

    ![](lab1_checkout_request.png)

3. We can change the HTTP method from `GET` to `OPTIONS` to see what is allowed and then test what we have found:

    ![](lab1_checkout_get.png)

    ![](lab1_checkout_post.png)

4. In the `GET` request's response there is a parameter called `chosen_discount` which includes a `percentage` value, but on the `POST` request there isn't. Thus, we can add it manually and set its value to `100`:

## Preventing vulnerabilities in APIs

When designing APIs, we must make sure that security is a consideration from the beginning:
- Secure your documentation if we don't intend our API to be publicly accessible.
- Ensure our documentation is kept up to date so the legitimate testers have full visibility of the API's attack surface.
- Apply an allowlist of permitted HTTP methods.
- Validate that the content type is expected for each request or response.
- Use generic error messages to avoid giving away info that may be useful for an attacker.
- Use protective measures on all API version, not just the current production one.

To prevent auto-binding vulnerabilities, we can allowlist the properties that can be updated by the user, and blocklist sensitive properties that should not be updated by the user.
