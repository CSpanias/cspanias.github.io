After having studied most of [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/)â€™s learning paths, I decided to focus on putting what I have been learning to practice and try my hand on its CTF challenges. Having said that, take what I write with a grain (or many grains) of salt, as I am completely new to all these concepts and tools, and I will be writing write ups mostly to learn myself.

Hopefully, aside from my own learning, people who are complete beginners, like myself, might find these posts helpful. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or fancy a team CTF challenge!
