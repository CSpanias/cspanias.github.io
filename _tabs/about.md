## Who Am I?

A [Strength & Conditioning coach (MSc)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NEcbEUYAAAAJ&hl=en) by trade, a [Cybersecurity undergrad (BSc)](https://www.open.ac.uk/courses/computing-it/degrees/bsc-cyber-security-r60), currently working as a Software Engineer at the FinTech domain.

Currently venturing in the **Penetration Testing** space, mostly, through the [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/) platform. After having studied most of its learning paths, I shifted my focus on putting the theory to practice by working on its Capture The Flag rooms. 

## Why Create Pages?

I will be writing write ups for all the completed CTFs, mostly as a learning method for myself. Hopefully, aside from my own learning, people who are complete beginners, like me, might find these posts helpful.

Feel free to grab a copy of my __[resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10_o6X0mdp6ivJW7FZl-7LnuP01U0OtPI/view?usp=sharing)__ while you are here.
