### :raising_hand_man: Who Am I?

A former [Strength & Conditioning (MSc)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NEcbEUYAAAAJ&hl=en) coach and a current [Cybersecurity (BSc)](https://www.open.ac.uk/courses/computing-it/degrees/bsc-cyber-security-r60) student working as a **Software Engineer**. Venturing in the **Penetration Testing** space through [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/), [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com/), [CISCO Networking Academy](https://www.netacad.com/), and [Open University](https://www.open.ac.uk/), currently focusing on **putting the theory into practice** by grinding through HTB's and THM's **Capture The Flag** rooms. 

You can find more about me by reading my up-to-date resume [<i class="fa-solid fa-file"></i>](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10_o6X0mdp6ivJW7FZl-7LnuP01U0OtPI/view?usp=sharing).

I am always game for a game of chess [<i class="fa-solid fa-chess"></i>](https://www.chess.com/member/spaniasch) or its human version [<i class="fa-solid fa-user-ninja"></i>](https://smoothcomp.com/en/profile/101916) !

### Why Pentest Journeys?

I will be writing write ups for all the completed CTFs for reviewing the process myself as well as digging into the nitty-gritty of each room. Hopefully, aside from my own benefit, people who are complete beginners, like me, might find these posts helpful.

Additionally, I plan to sit for the TMC's [PJPT](https://certifications.tcm-sec.com/pjpt/) and [PNPT](https://certifications.tcm-sec.com/pnpt/) certifications in the near future, so I aim to document my experience through TMC's training, and how it compares with THM's and HTB's learning paths in terms of quality, difficulty, subjects covered, and, of course, enjoyment.
