A [Strength & Conditioning coach (MSc)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NEcbEUYAAAAJ&hl=en) by trade and a [Cybersecurity undergrad (BSc)](https://www.open.ac.uk/courses/computing-it/degrees/bsc-cyber-security-r60) who currently works as a Software Engineer at the FinTech domain.

Currently venturing in the **Penetration Testing** space, mostly, through the 
[TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/) platform. After having studied most of its learning
 paths, I shifted my focus on *putting the theory to practice* by working on its 
**Capture The Flag rooms**. 

## Why Pentest Journeys?

I will be writing write ups for all the completed CTFs, mostly as a review method of as well ass a chance of digging into the nitty-gritty of each room. Hopefully, aside from my own benefit, people who are complete beginners, like me, might find these posts helpful.
