## Who Am I?
A former [Strength & Conditioning (MSc)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NEcbEUYAAAAJ&hl=en) coach and a current [Cybersecurity (BSc)] (https://www.open.ac.uk/courses/computing-it/degrees/bsc-cyber-security-r60) student working as a **Software Engineer** at the FinTech domain.

Venturing in the **Penetration Testing** space through [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/), [CISCO Networking Academy](https://www.netacad.com/), and [Open University](https://www.open.ac.uk/). Currently focusing on **putting the theory into practice** by grinding through THM's **Capture The Flag** rooms.

# Why Pentest Journeys?
I will be writing write ups for all the completed CTFs for reviewing the process myself as well as digging into the nitty-gritty of each room. Hopefully, aside from my own benefit, people who are complete beginners, like me, might find these posts helpful.

Additionally, I plan to sit for the TMC's [PJPT](https://certifications.tcm-sec.com/pjpt/) and [PNPT](https://certifications.tcm-sec.com/pnpt/) certifications in the near future, so I aim to document my experience through TMC's training, and how it compares with THM's learning paths in terms of quality, difficulty, subjects covered, and, of course, enjoyment.
