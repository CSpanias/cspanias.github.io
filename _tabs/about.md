After having studied most of [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/)â€™s amazing learning paths, I decided to focus on putting what I have been learning to practice, trying its CTF challenges. Having said that, take what I write with a grain (or many grains) of salt, as I am completely new to all these concepts and tools, and I will be writing write ups mostly to learn myself.

Hopefully, aside from my own learning, people who are complete beginners, like myself, might find these posts helpful.
