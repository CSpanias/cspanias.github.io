### Who Am I?

A [Strength & Conditioning (MSc)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NEcbEUYAAAAJ&hl=en) coach turned Penetration Tester with a short stop to Software Engineering. A [Cybersecurity (BSc)](https://www.open.ac.uk/courses/computing-it/degrees/bsc-cyber-security-r60) student trying to improve his pentesting and CTF skills through [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com/), [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/), and [PicoCTF](https://picoctf.org/).

Fancy a game of chess [<i class="fa-solid fa-chess"></i>](https://www.chess.com/member/spaniasch) or its human version [<i class="fa-solid fa-user-ninja"></i>](https://smoothcomp.com/en/profile/101916) ?

### Why Pentest Journeys?

I will be writing write ups for all the completed CTFs for reviewing the process myself as well as digging into the nitty-gritty of each room. Hopefully, aside from my own benefit, people who are complete beginners, like me, might find these posts helpful.

Additionally, I am currently studying for HTB's [CPTS](https://academy.hackthebox.com/preview/certifications/htb-certified-penetration-testing-specialist) certification, and after completing it, I plan to make a review of the [Penetration Tester Job Role Path](https://academy.hackthebox.com/path/preview/penetration-tester) as well as the exam itself.

I also have my eyes on TMC's [PNPT](https://certifications.tcm-sec.com/pnpt/) certification, and if I eventually sit for it, I aim to document my experience through TMC's training, and how it compares with THM's and HTB's resources in terms of quality, difficulty, subjects covered, and, of course, enjoyment.
