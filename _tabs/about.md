### Who Am I?

A [Strength & Conditioning (MSc)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NEcbEUYAAAAJ&hl=en) coach turned Penetration Tester with a short stop to Software Engineering. A [Cybersecurity (BSc)](https://www.open.ac.uk/courses/computing-it/degrees/bsc-cyber-security-r60) student trying to improve his pentesting and CTF skills through various platforms.

I have also been an Esports athlete in the game of ([Dota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_of_the_Ancients)/[Dota2](https://www.dota2.com/home)) for over a decade where I was always deeply involved in various local and international communities. As a result, I am also trying to be as involved as possible in CTF communities and you will find me lurking around in various Discord servers, such as [HackTheBox](https://discord.com/invite/hackthebox), [OUCSS](https://oucss.rocks/), and [WorkSmarter](https://www.linkedin.com/company/work-smarter-community/).

Fancy a game of chess [<i class="fa-solid fa-chess"></i>](https://www.chess.com/member/spaniasch) or its human version [<i class="fa-solid fa-user-ninja"></i>](https://smoothcomp.com/en/profile/101916) ?

### Why Pentest Journeys?

I will be writing write ups for all the completed CTFs for reviewing the process myself as well as digging into the nitty-gritty of each room. Hopefully, aside from my own benefit, people who are complete beginners, like me, might find these posts helpful.

Additionally, I am currently studying for HTB's [CPTS](https://academy.hackthebox.com/preview/certifications/htb-certified-penetration-testing-specialist) certification, and after completing it, I plan to make a review of the [Penetration Tester Job Role Path](https://academy.hackthebox.com/path/preview/penetration-tester) as well as the exam itself.
